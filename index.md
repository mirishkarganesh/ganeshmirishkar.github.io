Hi!

I am a PhD student at the Speech Processing Laboratory, [Language Technologies Research Center](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/) at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). My research interests lie in the speech signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning with applications to robust speech recognition, multilingual speech recognition, speech enhancement and audio analytics. 

Before joining as a Ph.D. scholar at the International Institute of Information Technology, I spent about 1 year 1 month as an Audio DSP Engineer - Algorithm developer at the Imagination Technologies (Currently Meeami Technologies), Hyd, India. I completed my Master of Technology (M.Tech) with Dr. Lalan Kumar and Dr. Bijayananda Patnaik, at Dept. of ECE, International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar , India.
